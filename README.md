# Challenge 3 Repo
For this challenge we are developing a prototype of a Patent Recomender System based on item filtering. 

## How to use

The user will set as input a small description of what it is intended to search and the system will return as an output the patents that are suited for the situation described.

## Technology

In this project, we are using [Gensim](https://radimrehurek.com/gensim/) Library, in particular, the Doc2vec model to analyse each patent regarding its title and abstract.
