            "Titulo: A locking arrangement for securing portable computers and the like against theft including a cable (40) with a cable head (36) extended by a first stem portion (42), a collar portion (38) and a free end second stem portion (44) all in axial alignment. A prismatic lock body (10) includes a push-in, keyoperated locking device (24) having a releasable locking detent (26'). The body (14) has front (12), rear (18) and two side surfaces (14; 16). First, second and third bores (30; 32; 34) are formed respectively at the front and two side surfaces, in a common plane, passing each other and being of a diameter slightly larger than that of the collar portion (38). The locking detent (26') is insertable behind the collar (38) and above the first stem portion (42) thus precluding the extraction of the cable head (36) when inserted into any of the bores. Also, the rear side surface of the lock body can be secured to a portion of the computer, e.g., by gluing. For securing originally slot equipped computers (122), the arrangement further includes a standard T-shaped spindle head (154), configured to fit into the slot (150) in one position and to prevent removal upon being rotated within the slot after stem (44) is also inserted into the slot.\n",

            "Titulo: An extended basic input output system (E-BIOS) has a first portion of code for providing power-on self-test (POST) and boot functions for a first computer, including code for sensing if the first computer does not boot. In the event of failure to boot, a second portion of code in the E-BIOS directs establishing communication link with a remote diagnostics and repair computer. When communication is established, a master code kernel at the diagnostics and repair computer may be executed to download a slave kernel to random access memory of the first computer, blowing an automatic software kernel or an operator at the diagnostics and repair computer to access and modify code and data in memory devices of the first computer, and to reboot the first computer after repair. Communication links may be by telephone modem, either analog or integrated Services Digital Network (ISDN), or by network links. In one embodiment cooperation between the slave kernel and the master kernel is such that an operator may operate the diagnostics and repair computer as though it were the first computer.\n",
